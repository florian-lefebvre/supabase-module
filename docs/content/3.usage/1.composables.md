Checkout the Nuxt3 documentation for [auto-imported composables](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) to learn more.

## `useSupabaseClient`

This composable is using [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/) under the hood, it gives acces to the [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client).

> The client is initialized with the `SUPABASE_KEY` you must have in your `.env` file. It establishes the connection with the database and make use of user JWT to apply [RLS Policies](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security) implemented in Supabase. If you want to bypass policies, you can use the [serverSupabaseServiceRole](/usage/services#serversupabaseservicerole).

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup>
const client = useSupabaseClient()

// Example: client.from('librairies').eq('name', 'Vue').single()
</script>
```

### Authentification

All authentification methods are available on [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup) Documentation.

Here is an example of the login using the `signIn` method with [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```vue [pages/login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()
const router = useRouter()

// Login method using providers
const login = async (provider: 'github' | 'google' | 'gitlab' | 'bitbucket') => {
  const { error } = await client.auth.signIn({ provider })

  if (error) {
    return alert('Something went wrong !')
  }

  router.push('/dashboard')
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="login('github')">Login with GitHub</button>
</template>
```

::alert
Thanks to the [Nuxt plugin](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins), we are listening to the [onAuthStateChange](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange) listener in order to update the user value according to the received event. We also keep the session consistency between client and server side.

### Database Request

Please check [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select) documentation to fully use the power of Supabase client.

Here is an example of a fetch using the `select` method with Nuxt 3 [useAsyncData](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/data-fetching#useasyncdata) composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const client = useSupabaseClient()

const { data: restaurant } = await useAsyncData('restaurant', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('restaurants').select('name, location').eq('name', 'My Restaurant Name').single()

  return data
})
</script>
```

## `useSupabaseUser`

Once logged in, you can access your user everywhere:

```vue
<script setup>
const user = useSupabaseUser()
</script>
```
